- Most users report that it does not work with NVIDIA GPUs.
- It is designed for the Steam Deck, which uses an AMD GPU, and should generally work on most AMD GPUs, though minor tweaks may be needed in some cases.
- For *multi-display* setups, some additional configuration may be required. Should work good with single display setups.
